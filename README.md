# Welcome to Ethan Latimer's GitHub page. 

### About Me

Graduate that specialises in Embedded Systems and Full-Stack web development. Still don't understand monads and likely never will unfortunately. 

The dotfiles for my workflows are [here](https://github.com/EthanLatimerGB/dotfiles). 

### Languages I mostly work with
* JavaScript/TypeScript - including .jsx and .vue files.
* PHP - mostly from Laravel.
* C/C++.
* ShellScripts (Bash, Zsh, etc.).
* Java.
* Haskell.

### Full-Stack Web Development

I have been a full-stack developer since 2020, learning it throughout the pandemic from [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). It introduced me to:

* ReactJS library for frontend **web**, as well as React Native for **mobile** development.
* NodeJS Backends.
* GraphQL and RESTful API formats.
* TypeScript.
* Docker and container deployment.

But, I also am familiar with another stack using the Laravel framework. I am working on a project that is currently **not public**, but I use the stack extensively to build deployable web software. 

### Embedded Systems Development

Getting a Raspberry Pi 2B board was my first introduction to low-performance, yet fully real-world software you could interact with. That interest grew during Unviersity with my fascination for performance, low-level software. My curiosities led me on a path of picking 3 very important modules: `Computer Systems 2`, `Real-Time Embedded Systems` and `Advanced Computer Architecture`. One pattern among these modules were the incredible lecturers and how they typcially always asked us very hard questions to make us think deeply about the material. 

#### Computer Systems 2

Module was very much an introduction to how most modern systems run at a fundamental level. Some highlights were:

* The C language and it's undefined/unspecified behaviour, as well as thread-safety and reentrancy.
* Analysis of the Pi Pico hardware, specifically the RP2040 chip datasheet. 
* Memory mappings.
* Multi-tasking and ISR's.
* Safety and Security of embedded hardware.
* Understanding of the FAT filesystem.
* Basics around Real-Time scheduling, including RMS, EDF and some dynamic schedulers.

#### Real-Time Embedded Systems

This module went into much greater detail than Computer Systems 2 when it came to real-time scheduling, introducing us also to FreeRTOS. But, we also learned about resource management. The other chunk saw us learn about embedded IP, with how they communicate and synchronise with multiple threads. 

#### Advanced Computer Architecture

My favourite module of the entire course - this type of content is why I wanted to study Computer Science at University. This module finally helped me understand how CPU's work fundamentally, and more importantly, how I can extract the most performance out of them. It taught me such valuable insight about:

* Pipelining and the important insight around avoiding wasted cycles due to hazards or fetches from memory.
* How CPU's can communicate effectively using Networks-On-Chip, as well as other communication layouts.
* Deciding your cache layouts, along with analysing memory performance from different bus layouts.
* Running simulations with Gem5 for performance analysis.
* Parralelism techniques on CPU's like multi-core, SIMD, VLIW and Superscalar.
* How GPU's fundamentally work, and how they can perform efficient work in software.

#### My Own Projects

Currently, my only embedded-systems project is my [Formula 1 Wheel](https://github.com/EthanLatimerGB/sys2-f1-wheel-sim) project.
